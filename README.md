AI Brain Computer Interface Data Interpretation

Project Overview
Developed a machine learning pipeline to differentiate EEG signals in a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system and evaluated 3D object classification performance using advanced models. 

Key Components:
âœ… Preprocessed and classified EEG signal datasets (e.g., Motor Imagery, OpenBCI) for brain state recognition.
ðŸ§  Integrated a 3D object dataset to test visual classification robustness under spatial transformations.
ðŸ”„ Implemented Spatial Transformer Networks (STN) in PyTorch/TensorFlow as the core model for spatial manipulation and alignment.
ðŸ“Š Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision-recall, confusion matrix.

Tools & Technologies:
Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, OpenBCI, NumPy, Matplotlib, Keras, pandas, 3D object datasets.

Outcome:
Spatial Transformer Networks outperformed classical models by accurately learning invariant spatial transformations in both EEG and 3D object datasets, demonstrating superior generalization and interpretability.
